# The Swear Jar

It's about what it sounds like. Here we have a Chrome extension that monitors your colorful language on the internet.

## Disclaimer/Warnings

This extension can and will basically search through all your request data for bad words. If you're concerned about privacy, this probably isn't the best extension for you (although we never store anything except the balance in your swear jar).

When your swear jar is full, the extension also locks you out of your browser by redirecting everything to The Swear Jar. It'll stop if you make a (fake) payment to a (sandbox) PayPal account. Another way to circumvent this is by simply visiting [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and disabling the extension.

Have fun, and let us know if you encounter any bugs!
